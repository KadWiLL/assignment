        <h1>Strengths</h1>
        <p>I would say that my three mayjor strengths as it relates to computing are reading logical code, analyzing and wtiring code.
            <br> As a sofware developer these are very important traits to have because it helps solve technical problems in the work environment.
        </p>

        <h1>The Twelve Pillars</h1>
        <p>Chapter 4 describes a dinner meeting between Charlie, an older maintenance man who worked at Twelve Pillars, and Michael,
            a mid-age man with a wife and two kids. Charlie worked for Mr. Davis, a very successful, wealthy man, and he is passing
            down some of his teachings about success to Michael, who feels he is not living up to his potential at work and has been
            having troubles in his relationship with his wife. A previous lesson from Charlie on how to put effort, time and imagination
            into his relationships, proved to be helpful for Michael. The advice to treat his relationhip like a garden inspired him to make
            time for a date night with his wife each week where she chooses whatever she wants to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            In chapter 4, Charlie teaches him about the power of writing down goals, and tells him to start by writing down a hundred things
            he wants to accomplish before he dies. This process makes the mind aware of them and gets to work on how to achieve them. He then
            goes on to teach him on how to set long-range goals, mid-range goals, short-range goals and even micro-goals,emphasizing that the
            major reason for setting a goal is for it makes of one to accomplish that goal.
        </p>

        <p>
            In chapter 5, Charlie continues to teach Michael about the proper use of time as he complained he wouldn't have the time to change the
            direction of his life when he is overwhelmed by work, wife and kids, etc. Here, Charlie talks about two types of pain: the pain of
            discipline and the pain of regret. When you are on the bed of death, the things you wanted to do in your lifetime, but you haven't been 
            able to achieve will cause deep regrets. Charlie also mentions a time management trap that a lot of people fall into, that is spending 
            their time on the urgentrather than the important. He also encourages Michael to be the designer of his own life, and to be the master 
            of time rather than becoming a slave to it.
        </p>

        <p>
            In chapter 6, Michael comes to share his achievements with Charlie at Twelve Pillars and he finds him cleaning the pool. His relationship
            with his wife kept improving and he wrote down the 100 goals of his life. When he asked about the next Pillar of Success, Charlie started to 
            teach him about how to surround himself with the best people, about the power that people in his life have to influence and affect him. Together 
            they start analyzing 3 of Michael's best friends, and he starts to see things in a different perspective led by Charlie's questions on what 
            kind of influence they have on him, their attitudes and how they affect him. Charlie also talks about the importance of developing new relationships 
            with successful people who will push him, challenge him and encourage him to become better. Hanging around and associating with more successful people 
            will lead to three things: -he will open up to new knowledge about how the world works, how business works, how to better relationships; -he will open 
            up to a vast new network; -his attitude will change. And that is important because 99% of life is attitude. And attittude is greatly shaped by influence 
            and association.
        </p>

        <p>
            In chapter 7, Charlie teaches Michael about the importance of learning, self-education, and reading books. Although he is resistant to the idea of reading
            books at first, Charlie is able to persuade him, when he refuses to meet Michael again until he has read one book. Charlie gives him a sheet of paper with
            Mr. Davis's list of "Books Everyone Should Read" and also offers him one of the books ("The Magic of Thinking Big") for free. Michael leaves the place feeling 
            hopeful and reassured that he can continue to learn the Pillars of Success once he finishes reading his book.
        </p>

        <p>
            In each chapter there is a lesson to be learnt, and a process of self-analyzing is triggered through the lenses of Michael's efforts to understand these pillars 
            of success and how they apply to him and his situation. Personally, I believe I could benefit most from the pillar of success in chapter 4. Writing down my goals 
            would help me to focus more my energy in that direction, acknowledge my goals and define them. Also, I believe learning to be the master of your time is crucial.
